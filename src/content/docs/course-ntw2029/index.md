title: Welcome to Evolutionary Psychology and Art!
---
<!--- last updated 2024-06-30 --->

Although we enjoy watching movies, reading novels, and listening to music, we might think that these are not very productive ways to spend our time. Yet every society throughout history has devoted significant resources to creating and enjoying art. Why is this the case? Some scholars have proposed that there is an evolved, biological "human nature" that can help explain why people are psychologically inclined to create and consume art, particularly art that tells stories. Just as songbirds have evolved the ability to create complex melodies, the argument goes, humans have evolved an ability to create and enjoy complex images, music, and stories. We will address questions such as: why does every human culture have art? Why do we enjoy hearing made up stories about people who don't exist? Why do beautiful models date ugly rock stars? And why do we like watching good guys beat bad guys?

Like all Thinking With Writing modules, "Evolutionary Psychology and Art" is fundamentally a course in effective academic writing. This particular section will teach students to write effective arguments by discussing and evaluating theories that use evolutionary psychology to understand art and its effects on audiences. In doing so, students will also learn general concepts about critical thinking, humanist and scientific methods, evidence, and the nature of proof that can be applied to nearly any academic area. No prior knowledge of biology, art, or any other topic is necessary to succeed in the course.

If you have previously studied art or literature, you should know that this course studies these areas differently than you may have done so in the past. We do not focus on close examination of individual works with the goal of appreciating them by identifying their formal features or themes. We focus on art as a concept and understanding how art and its effects can be better understood. The course discusses art more in terms of groups, such as specific art forms or genres, than it does individual works.

## Meet the Instructor

### Dr. Jonathan Frome's mini intellectual history

I received a BA in Philosophy at Amherst College, an MA in English at the University of Florida, Gainesville, and a PhD in Communication Arts (Film Studies) at the University of Wisconsin—Madison. In graduate school, I learned about cognitive film theory, which aims to use cognitive psychology to understand how audiences respond to films. This theory sparked my continuing interest in the intersections between science and humanities. My dissertation research used cognitive theory to better understand some of the differences in emotional response between films and video games. After many years developing these theories of emotion, I have recently grown more skeptical about our ability to study emotional responses to media. Figuring out the capabilities and limitations of emotion research is one of my main interests. I also study video game theory, philosophy of emotion, and I am engaged in collaborative empirical research with psychologists at other universities.

## Do You Need Help?

If you are having trouble, ask for help. I am easily accessible outside of class.

- In person: I am on campus most days. I can often meet students briefly after class, but for longer conversations, contact me to arrange a meeting time.
- By email: Email me questions at any time (although please check this site first for answers to questions about course logistics). I will do my best to respond promptly. If I don't respond within one business day, or if the matter is time-sensitive, feel free to email me again to remind me. I won't be annoyed. Sometimes an email just gets buried in my inbox.
- Canvas messaging: please email me rather than sending me a message through Canvas.

### Teaching Style & Philosophy

- I try to be 100% upfront and straightforward. I'm not trying to trick you, keep things secret, or make you read my mind. If something's not clear, it's not on purpose—just ask and I'll clarify.
- I often use a method called the "Socratic method," named after the Ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. The Socratic method involves me asking questions and then playing "devil's advocate" by challenging your answers. Often, you won't have an answer right away, and then your brain hurts. That's what learning feels like. The goal is to help you learn to think critically and to evaluate arguments.
- The Socratic method can sometimes make students feel like I am criticizing them personally or trying to make them feel dumb. Please know that I am not criticizing you; I am encouraging everyone to evaluate the answer. Don't take it personally! You are in class to learn the answers. You are not supposed to know them yet.
- If you suggest an answer that doesn't work, good for you for putting yourself out there and trying out an idea! I respect that.
- I am NEVER trying to make students feel bad. If you ever feel that I am making fun of you or another student, or being disrespectful, please tell me ASAP. I promise I won't hold it against you. I'm in a new culture in Singapore, and I may make mistakes, so please let me know if I do.
- I do not mind at all being interrupted during class with questions. Just raise your hand and ask. If you miss something, rather than whispering to your classmate (which is distracting), just ask me and I will happily go back to review whatever you missed.
- I have a dry or deadpan sense of humor, which means that I will sometimes make jokes without calling attention to the fact that I am making a joke. If I say something that seems ridiculous or odd, it's probably just me failing in my humor. Feel free to ask if I'm joking.
- When I am excited about something, I speak quickly. Ask me to slow down or repeat myself. You are not being rude; it's no big deal.

### Additional notes on course expectations

- The ideas in this course are complicated. I don't expect that you will understand everything in the readings and discussion without help.
- If I use a word or concept that you don't know, just ask me what it means, and I'll tell you. I won't judge you or think you're dumb. It's not your fault if no one ever told you what "salient" means.
- Since students have very different backgrounds, I don't know what you already know. You must ask questions if you don't know something and want to understand it. Your education is your responsibility.
- I will often ask if you have any questions about what we've just discussed. DO NOT HESITATE to stop me even if you're not quite sure what you don't understand. Just say, "I didn't get that. Can you say it again?"
