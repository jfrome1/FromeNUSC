Although we enjoy watching movies, reading novels, and listening to music, we might think that these are not very productive ways to spend our time. Yet every society throughout history has devoted significant resources to creating and enjoying art. Why is this the case? Some scholars have proposed that there is an evolved, biological "human nature" that can help explain why people are psychologically inclined to create and consume art, particularly art that tells stories. Just as songbirds have evolved the ability to create complex melodies, the argument goes, humans have evolved an ability to create and enjoy complex images, music, and stories. We will address questions such as: why does every human culture have art? Why do we enjoy hearing made up stories about people who don't exist? Why do beautiful models date ugly rock stars? And why do we like watching good guys beat bad guys?

Like all Thinking With Writing modules, "Evolutionary Psychology and Art" is fundamentally a course in effective academic writing. This particular section will teach students to write effective arguments by discussing and evaluating theories that use evolutionary psychology to understand art and its effects on audiences. In doing so, students will also learn general concepts about critical thinking, humanist and scientific methods, evidence, and the nature of proof that can be applied to nearly any academic area. No prior knowledge of biology, art, or any other topic is necessary to succeed in the course.

If you have previously studied art or literature, you should know that this course studies these areas differently than you may have done so in the past. We do not focus on close examination of individual works with the goal of appreciating them by identifying their formal features or themes. We focus on art as a concept and understanding how art and its effects can be better understood. The course discusses art more in terms of groups, such as specific art forms or genres, than it does individual works.
