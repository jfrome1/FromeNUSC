## evolution and religion

- some people believe that acceptance of Darwin's theory of evolution requires rejection of their religious beliefs
- the best way to know whether someone rejects evolution is not by knowing whether the person believes in God, as many people believe in both God and evolution, but their belief about the age of the Earth
- the disagreement occurs because some Christians think the Bible is literally true, as in every sentence is a statement of fact, while others think the Bible's messages are true, but not that every single sentence is literally true on its own (e.g. they don't think that the Bible's mention of the "four corners of the Earth" means that the Earth is not round).
- Biblical literalists have gone through the births and deaths of people named in the Bible and added them up to determine the age of the Earth, which they say is less than 10k years
- others think the Earth is billions of years old based on scientific evidence
	- if you want to know how scientists estimate the age of the earth, a short discussion of evidence is found in this [article](https://biologos.org/common-questions/how-are-the-ages-of-the-earth-and-universe-calculated), or you can take a deeper look with videos such as these:
	- [How Old is the Earth?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veit8_NESxU)
	- [How We Know The Earth Is Ancient - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAgiHreswj0)
- if your religious beliefs allow for the idea that the earth is roughly 4.5 billion years old, then evolution and religion are fairly compatible
 	- you can say that God created the diversity of life using evolution as a mechanism, and evolution is one of many biological laws of nature that God created when the universe was created, along with laws of physics and chemistry
 	- you might argue that evolution and science explain *how* diversity of life is created, and religion explains *why* it was created
 	- consider an analogy: astronomers can explain how the planets orbit each other, and we discovered the mechanisms such as gravity that govern planetary orbits relatively recently, but the accepting theory of gravity does not mean that you reject the notion that God created the universe
- if you think that the earth is less than 10,000 years old, then there is potentially serious conflict between evolution and religion, because evolutionary theory requires millions of years to explain how so many species were created
 	- there are at least two ways that you might resolve this conflict:
 	- 1) you might say that the science is wrong, the earth is young, and evolution is false
		- this is extremely difficult to do, because the scientific evidence is really overwhelming
 	- 2) you might say that the Earth and the scientific evidence supporting evolution were both created within the last 10,000 years
		- e.g. you could argue that ice cores were created 10,000 years ago already having 45,000 layers, and 1 layer has been added every year since, which makes it seem like the ice sheets are 50,000 years old
		- people who adopt this position sometimes argue that God might have done this as a test of faith
- other resources discussing evolution and religion:
	- as mentioned in class, Biologos is a website by Christian organization that supports evolutionary theory. If you are interested in this, you might start with their article on [Evolutionary Creationism](https://biologos.org/common-questions/how-is-biologos-different-from-evolutionism-intelligent-design-and-creationism/) and explore more of the site from there.
