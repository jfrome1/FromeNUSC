## P2: how am I supposed to use the sources that are not my main source?

- There are a few ways to use your other sources:
	- to help describe the academic conversation
	- to support your claims; e.g. if you claim that horror films are currently one of the most popular film genres, you can cite a source as evidence that your claim is true
	- to present arguments about your main source (if the other source discusses your main source)

# EP—is it valid?

## What is the value of EP explanations? Why does it matter if we have an explanation for why people cooperate or make art?

## Isn't EP just speculation?

## Aren't there many causes for things people do, and doesn't this fact make it impossible to know how important any one cause is?

## What is a herustic? What does it mean to use EP as a heuristic?

- Heuristics are rules of thumb or guidelines that provide simple ways to approach potentially complex problems. A heuristic for picking a restaurant is that a crowded restaurant is more likely to be good than an empty restaurant. Heuristics are not always accurate but they are potentially helpful. To say that we can use EP as a heuristic means that, when trying to explain human behavioral traits, we can develop hypotheses by imagining how those traits might have been adaptive in the EEA. We should then test these hypotheses to decide whether they are plausible/supported or not.

## Can you explain the idea that a heuristic use of EP has almost no limits on its proposed problems and solutions?

- First, note that Goldfinch conveys this criticism of EP, but he doesn't actually agree with that criticism. He is just explaining it in a charitable manner. Next, look at the answer above about heuristic use of EP. Lastly, remember that in the heuristic context, "solution" refers to an evolved adaptive trait, and "problem" refers to a selection pressure that acts as a potential obstacle to survival and reproduction. So the challenge to EP is not about endless solutions proposed by researchers, but that there are few limits to explanations for adaptive traits, meaning that for almost any trait/solution, someone can propose a story "explaining" how the solution might be a way to overcome some obstacle/problem.

## Can you explain Schulz's objection that EP is explanatory, not heuristic?

# Pinker reading

## How can art be a supernormal stimulus?
