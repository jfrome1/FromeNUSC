## useful Wikipedia pages

Wikipedia is very useful when first learning about a new topic. I myself use Wikipedia frequently, but I know that it is not something you can cite in academic writing. This article will help you understand the strengths and weaknesses of Wikipedia: [Is Wikipedia a credible source? - Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/g/wikipedia-credible-source/)

## Evolution, general

- [What is Evolution?](https://youtu.be/GhHOjC4oxh8) (9 min)
	- "Evolution is often considered a complex and controversial topic but it's actually a very simple concept to understand. Watch this short animation to see how evolution works. Share it with your friends on Facebook who might be confused or may have been mislead about the evolutionary process."
- [What is the Evidence for Evolution?](https://youtu.be/lIEoO5KdPvg) (12 min)
	- "Biologists teach that all living things on Earth are related. Is there any solid evidence to back this claim? Join us as we explore the facts! We start with a close look at the origin of whales from land mammals, and then touch on the origins of several other critters, including our own species."
- [Survival Of The Fittest — What does it REALLY mean?](https://youtu.be/nUSTpO7-igw) (8 min)
	- "When many people think of evolution by natural selection, they think "Survival of the Fittest". This phrase is often interpreted to mean "only the strong shall survive" but when you look at how common tiny microbes are, that interpretation is clearly not true. What does survival of the fittest really mean?"
- [How Evolution works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfRN0KihOU) (12 min)
	- "The mechanisms of evolution explained in one video. The theory of evolution explains how the enormous variety of life could come into existence. How it is possible for primitive life forms to spawn the millions of different creatures, that exist today. Unfortunately, evolution is often misunderstood, because it's mechanisms seem counter intuitive. By using visualizations, infographics and appealing characters, the viewer is more likely to understand it the complex information. More than that, by presenting the information in an entertaining way, the information is more likely to sink in."
- [Does the Theory of Evolution Really Matter?](https://youtu.be/hqepQGOYKZ0) (10 min)
	- "Students who may be disinterested or uncomfortable with the science of evolution often wonder why it is worth their time and effort to understand. Stated Clearly and Emory University's Center for Science Education have joined forces to create this animation addressing these concerns. The discovery of biological evolution is among the most significant scientific findings of the last 200 years. It has lead us to thousands of new discoveries and is greatly expanding our understanding of the natural world. Here we look at 3 mysteries which were solved by using Darwin's theory of evolution. The understanding we have gained is having a dramatic impact on food security, disease control, and environmental conservation."

## Evolution—Is it really true?

- [Evolution: It's a Thing - Crash Course Biology #20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3GagfbA2vo)
- [Myths and misconceptions about evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZt1Gn0R22Q&list=PLD018AC9B25A23E16&index=80)
	- "How does evolution really work? Actually, not how some of our common evolutionary metaphors would have us believe. For instance, it's species, not individual organisms, that adapt to produce evolution, and genes don't "want" to be passed on -- a gene can't want anything at all! Alex Gendler sets the record straight on the finer points of evolution."
- [Richard Dawkins: Show me the intermediate fossils!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o92x6AvxCFg)
	- "Richard Dawkins shows how whales evolved from a cloven-hoofed ancestor, and reveals whales' closest modern-day cousin."
- [The 12 Days of Evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_jyHp3bmEw) combines 12 short, accessible videos about evolution into one longer one, with these topics:
	- [What is evolution, anyway?](https://youtu.be/c_jyHp3bmEw?t=10)
	- [Is evolution random?](https://youtu.be/c_jyHp3bmEw?t=84)

## Evolution—isn't it just a theory?

- Is evolution "just a theory"? What "theory" and "law" mean in science vs. ordinary language
	- a good written explanation: part 1—[When Does a Theory Become a Law? | The Happy Scientist](https://www.thehappyscientist.com/content/when-does-theory-become-law) and part 2—[Is Gravity a Theory or a Law? | The Happy Scientist](https://www.thehappyscientist.com/science-experiment/gravity-theory-or-law)
	- video: ["Why Science is Not 'Just a Theory'"](http://youtu.be/1uzsuCFUQ68)
	- video: [Why You Should Never Say "It's Just A Theory"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0H-amOti_o)
		- "A portion of our culture distrusts the scientific method, assuming that there are transcendent truths unknowable by science. But nothing is truly out of bounds for science. If it's real, it can be studied, and tested. Perhaps the greatest misunderstanding our culture has about the scientific method involves the definition of the word "theory". A theory is not a guess, and this word does not in any way imply uncertainty about the validity of a concept or an equation. Watch this and learn more about the terms hypothesis, theory, and law."

## Speciation

- [Carl Sagan - COSMOS - Evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZpsVSVRsZk)
	- _This is a poetic animated description of how species repeatedly branched off from earlier species, eventually leading to humans._
- [Speciation: Of Ligers & Men - Crash Course Biology #15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oKlKmrbLoU)
- [Evolution of dogs Explained by Neil deGrasse Tyson - Excerpt - Cosmos A space time Odyssey - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQHBmY6LbiA)
	- _Speciation of dogs from wolves based, in part, on human intervention_
- [There Was No First Human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdWLhXi24Mo)
	- _This discussion of the first human helps explain the concept of speciation and species more broadly_
- [Which Came First - The Chicken or the Egg?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a8pI65emDE)
	- "It has perplexed humanity from as early as the Ancient Greeks. So which came first, the chicken or the egg? We take a crack at this curious conundrum."

## Natural selection

- [What is Natural Selection?](https://youtu.be/0SCjhI86grU) (10 min)
	- "Natural selection can be defined as the process by which random evolutionary changes are selected for by nature in a consistent, orderly, non-random way. When coupled with descent with modification, Natural Selection can cause a population to evolve for fitness within a given environment over multiple generations. Natural Selection is an observable fact. By carefully observing populations of living things with short life cycles you can actually watch it happen."
- [Heredity - Crash Course Biology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBezq1fFUEA)
- [Natural Selection - Crash Course Biology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTftyFboC_M)
- [What is Impossible in Evolution?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkS1U5lfSRw)
	- "Could humans ever evolve to have wings? Why don't fish have propellers? Why don't tigers have wheels? Why don't zebras have laser turrets? These might all seem like stupid questions (and maybe they are!) but they can teach us a lot about how evolution actually works, and how it doesn't work."
- [Mechanisms of Natural Selection Part 2: Conflict, Spite, and Reciprocity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOfj9LxA7QY)
	- "We learned about how altruism can evolve in certain species, which involves cooperative behavior among closely-related organisms to enhance the inclusive fitness of the group. But this is also achieved through spiteful behavior towards less closely-related organisms. Let's check out the other side of the coin and examine conflict-based animal behavior."
- [Simulating Natural Selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM)
- [Simulating Competition and Logistic Growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRTtlpD_U54)
- [Simulating the Evolution of Aggression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNMkADpvO4w)

## DNA, genes, chromosomes

- [What is DNA and How Does it Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwibgNGe4aY)
	- "This animated short film has been made for those wanting a simple introduction (or even a refresher) on how DNA creates a living creature. In this video you will learn a bit about genetic code, DNA transcription and translation, and the importance of proteins in the chemistry of life."
- [DNA Doesn't Look Like What You Think!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT9T9h-2Jp8&list=PLsmqeqKj7M-rZTTXNXuL07poGP5B6TKKu&index=71)
	- "Biology textbooks are full of drawings of DNA, but none of those show what DNA actually looks like. Sure, they're good models for understanding how DNA works, but inside of real cells, it's a whole lot more interesting. Learn why we can't look directly at DNA, and find out how DNA is actually packed inside cells."
- [What is a gene?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MQdXjRPHmQ)
	- "You've probably heard about GMOs or Genetically Modified Organisms but what exactly is a gene and what does it mean to modify the genes of a plant or animal? Here we discuss a basic definition of a gene, show what a gene looks like, what it is that genes actually code for, and the basic idea behind Genetically Modified Organisms."
- [Where do genes come from?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9HIYjRRaDE)
	- "When life emerged on Earth about 4 billion years ago, the earliest microbes had a set of basic genes that succeeded in keeping them alive. In the age of humans and other large organisms, there are a lot more genes to go around. Where did all of those new genes come from? Carl Zimmer examines the mutation and multiplication of genes. "
- [What is a Chromosome?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IePMXxQ-KWY)
	- "Ever get confused about the difference between DNA, genes, and Chromosomes? If so, don't worry. We straighten it all out here!"

## Common ancestry

- [Richard Dawkins: Why are there still Chimpanzees?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh0F4FBLJRE)
	- "Richard Dawkins clears up the misunderstanding of Evolution that is all too common: If we descended from Chimpanzees, then why are there still Chimpanzees? Dawkins explains that we DID NOT descend from Chimpanzees—we both share a common ancestor."
	- [Why are there still monkeys?](https://youtu.be/c_jyHp3bmEw?t=751)
- [Proof of Evolution Is Hiding in Your DNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GfKZlTRNjA&list=PLsmqeqKj7M-rZTTXNXuL07poGP5B6TKKu&index=54)
	- "Humans are special, and we got that way thanks to evolution and natural selection. The proof is right there in our bodies! From anatomy to genes, here are some stories of how you got to be the way you are."
- [DNA Evidence That Humans & Chimps Share A Common Ancestor: Endogenous Retroviruses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXfDF5Ew3Gc) (13 min)
	- "Here we explore the amazing discovery of Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs) in our own DNA. These are genetic remnants of antient virus infections suffered by our ancestors. It turns out that many of our Endogenous Retroviruses are shared by chimpanzees. This is because we share a common ancestor with them."
	- *This fairly technical video provides compelling evidence that humans and chimps share a common ancestor.*

## Mutations

- [Part 1: How Does New Genetic Information Evolve? Point Mutations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlhpvcgK_28)
	- "This film is the first of a two part series on the evolution of new genetic information. Here we focus on Point Mutations - the simplest natural mechanisms known to increase the genetic information of a population. Point mutations are small, natural edits in the DNA code of an individual. These edits can be passed from parent to child. Because they are mere edits, point mutations usually do not increase the total amount of information in an individual. As new information is gained, old information is lost. Point mutations do, however, increase the total amount of information within a population. In this film you will see several examples of beneficial point mutations which have enhanced a creatures abilities or even given rise to entirely new abilities. The first two examples were directly observed in bacteria by scientists in the lab. The third is a case found in domestic dogs, the last example was discovered in several species of wild animal."
- [Part 2: How Does New Genetic Information Evolve? Gene Duplications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4VINRUe_o4)
	- "Here we see how duplication events can dramatically lengthen the genetic code of an individual. As point mutations add up in the duplicated region across generations, entirely new genes with new functions can evolve. In the video we see three examples of gene duplications resulting in new traits for the creatures who inherit them: the evolution of a  venom gene in snakes, the evolution of leaf digestion genes in monkeys, and the evolution of burrowing legs in hunting dogs."

## Gene's eye view of evolution (aka the selfish gene theory)

- [What Is The Gene's Eye View of Evolution?](https://youtu.be/KqdlBOoZsXo) (13 min)
	- "The Gene's Eye View of evolution, sometimes called the "Selfish Gene Concept" or the "Genetical Theory", is a foundational concept in biological evolution. Here you will learn why taking a gene's eye view of life can be so important when trying to solve complex mysteries in evolutionary biology."
- [What's a "selfish gene"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mTVtToioLg)
- [Are Genes Really Selfish? - Instant Egghead #57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZlOjVtnRx4) (3 min)
	- "Biologist Richard Dawkins coined the phrase "the selfish gene" with his best-selling book of the same name. "Selfish", however, was an unfortunate word choice because genes lack a will and can actually drive altruism. Scientific American editor Eric R. Olson explains."

## Sexual selection

- [Why Is Sex a Thing?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdceuaRZno4&list=PLsmqeqKj7M-rZTTXNXuL07poGP5B6TKKu&index=12)
	- "Why does sex exist? You might think the obvious answer is "reproduction" but there are plenty of organisms on Earth that don't require sex to reproduce. And the more that scientists examined sex, they more they realized that it's an expensive and inefficient way to get your genes to the next generation. The true purpose of sex is actually one of the longest-standing mysteries in evolutionary biology. But scientists are closer than ever to finding the answer. Here's what we know about the evolutionary enigma of sex."
- [Natural Selection & Sexual Selection: An Illustrated Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxHdzw7E0wU) (9 min)
	- "How does evolution happen? Through a gradual process called selection. Individuals that are better equipped to survive and reproduce pass those traits to their offspring. These "selected" changes accumulate over thousands of years. We tend to think of natural selection—"survival of the fittest"—but sexual selection works the same way and can be just as strong in shaping how species look and act."
- [Mechanisms of Natural Selection Part 1: Types of Sexual Selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh9lCV8-TcY)
	- "We touched upon sexual selection when we learned about natural selection. Essentially when there is a variance in the reproductive success of a particular sex for a given species, secondary sex characteristics will develop in that species, because one sex has the opportunity to choose a mate among the other sex, with females choosing males being most typical. How do these evolve and how are they selected for? What is intrasexual selection vs. intersexual selection? Let's learn about this now!"
- ['Flaunting It'--Sexual Selection and the Art of Courtship](http://youtu.be/g3B8hS80k6A)
	- *This one is a bit challenging to process but it has many important ideas in it.*
- [Sexual Selection vs Natural Selection | A Comparison of | Koaw Nature - 3 min](https://youtu.be/SAt0Z9KJkqY)
- [Darwin Day Special! What is Sexual Selection? - 10 min](https://youtu.be/184dRcLClQ0)
- Useful examples--animals
	- [Our Planet | Birds Of Paradise dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX40mBb8bkU)
	- [World's Weirdest--Birds _Moonwalk_ to Impress the Ladies](http://youtu.be/o42C6ajjqWg)
	- [Moonwalk Manakin Bird](http://youtu.be/UOLTj7Y268s) (better soundtrack)
	- [World's Weirdest--Bowerbird Woos Female with Ring](http://youtu.be/U89tw093s_Y)
	- [Puffer Fish carves crop circles in Amami Oshima](http://youtu.be/IO-NI7qbUrM)
		- *This "crop circle" is to attract females, who lay eggs in the circle for fertilization. Note that this must be evolved behavior, because the fish isn't smart enough to have any idea what he is doing. But it's so strange that evolution can create behavior like this!*
- Useful examples--humans
	- [Are Short Men at a Disadvantage in Romance?](http://youtu.be/AR3YR1ZTonc)
		- *The bit at the very end that is hard to hear is a woman saying "I guess the only thing you could say is that the other four are criminals [or something like that]." You can then hear in the background another woman saying "psychotic"!*
		- [Will Dancing Get You Laid?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqx0-ol5qeQ)

## Altruism, Symbiosis, and Cooperation

- [What is Symbiosis?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eChtyqSqUIs)
	- "Normally when people talk about "symbiosis", they're talking about two or more different organisms cooperating to better survive and reproduce. The classical definition of symbiosis is actually much broader than this, and for good reason. Here we will look how evolutionary biologists understand symbiosis, all its different forms, and why it matters!"
- [Richard Dawkins on Altruism and The Selfish Gene - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8C-ntwUpzM)
- [Simulating the Evolution of Sacrificing for Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLX_r_WPrIw)
- [How Does Cooperation Evolve?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tz6WE4ALUs)
	- _Note: this video is about cooperation between different species, not between individual members of the same species._
	- "Lichen is a combination of algae and fungus (and in many cases, a third species of yeast) living together. This relationship allows the intertwined organisms to survive in locations they could never live on their own. If evolution is all about "survival of the fittest", how does cooperation evolve? Living things form cooperative relationships all the time. Research done by applying mathematics to biology is helping us understand the evolution of cooperation. Cooperation has caused some of the major evolutionary steps in the history of life, including the step from single celled creatures to multi-cellular plants and animals. Scientists used mathematical models to find scenarios in which natural selection will actually favor cooperation."
- [The Evolution of Human Cooperation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5MoMG1vJw) (17 min)
	- "Ever wonder how we transformed ourselves from small groups of insignificant primates to modern civilisation?  It's tempting to think technological innovations were the driving forces. The invention of tools, fire, the printing press, fossil fuels, the industrial revolution, etc.  However, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt offers an alternative explanation. He argues that it was psychological innovations, rather than technological, that ultimately got us to where we are.  In this presentation, I cover three of these innovations, and how they might help explain this mystery."
- [Wired for Culture: The natural history of human cooperation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdhG7WX9Fmg) (17 min)
	- "Please be aware that there are some images used in this talk of a violent nature. Mark Pagel, one of the world's leading experts on human evolution and development, visits the RSA to investigate our species' capacity for culture, cooperation and community."

## Nature/nurture and epigenitics

- [Is Height Genetic?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cuO5OSDMbw&list=PLsmqeqKj7M-rZTTXNXuL07poGP5B6TKKu&index=50)
	- "I'm tall. Most of the people in my family are tall. Does that mean my son will be tall? Turns out the inheritance of height is a lot more complicated than we thought. Scientists know that nature (genes) and nurture (environment) both play a role, but after more than a century of questions, we're only just now starting to get some answers"
- [How Do Genes Influence Behavior? - Instant Egghead #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvk2g9hJMTs)
	- "Liberal or conservative; gay or straight; adventurous or cautious: How do genes influence our behavior and predispositions? Scientific American's Christine Gorman explains why the answer to this question is more complex than it first appears."
- [Is Epigenetic Inheritance Real? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81rFpRsF80c&list=PLsmqeqKj7M-rZTTXNXuL07poGP5B6TKKu&index=101)
	- "Epigenetic inheritance is really weird, but is it real?"
- [What is epigenetics? - Carlos Guerrero-Bosagna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aAhcNjmvhc)
	- "Here's a conundrum: Identical twins originate from the same DNA ... so how can they turn out so different — even in traits that have a significant genetic component? Carlos Guerrero-Bosagna explains that while nature versus nurture has a lot to do with it, a deeper, related answer can be found within something called epigenetics."

## Observed evolution

- [The Longest-Running Evolution Experiment - Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4sLAQvEH-M) (17 min)
	- "If you ran evolution all over again, would you get humans? How repeatable is evolution?"

## Human evolution

- [Seven Million Years of Human Evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZv8VyIQ7YU)
- [There Was No First Human - Be Smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdWLhXi24Mo) (4 min)
	- "If you traced your family tree back 185 million generations through evolution, you wouldn't be looking at a human, a primate, or even a mammal. You'd be looking at a fish. So where along that line does the first human show up? The answer may surprise you!"
- [Where Did Humans Come From?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD9AYN7JnFM&list=PLsmqeqKj7M-pS2SyV82Y4CGyihKLCW35w&index=2)
	- "In part 1 of our special series on human ancestry, we tour through our family tree to meet our ancestors and distant cousins, and to find out what made us human along the way. The story of human ancestry is not a simple progression from primitive apes to us, with all the ape/human intermediates in between. The real human story is much richer and more complex, full of branches, gaps, and shadowy parts. A century and a half of fossil finds tells us perhaps two dozen human species lived on Earth between now and the time when our ancestors split from chimpanzee ancestors. The new era of DNA and genetics is upending that story yet again."
- [Why Are We The Only Humans Left?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbHj-Q1FTj8)
	- "In part 2 of our special series on human ancestry, we ask why we are the only surviving branch on the human evolutionary tree. Just 50,000-100,000 years ago, Earth was home to three or four separate human species, including our most famous cousins: the Neanderthals. New research has shown that Neanderthals were not the brutish, unintelligent cavemen that cartoons make them out to be. They were creative, smart, social, and perhaps even had complex language. So why did they go extinct as soon as Homo sapiens moved into their territory? Does any trace of them live on today? Why don't we have Neanderthal neighbors?"
- [Are We All Related?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnYSMhR3jCI&list=PLsmqeqKj7M-pS2SyV82Y4CGyihKLCW35w&index=3)
	- "In part 3 of our special series on human ancestry, we investigate how closely related we all really are. Basic math tells us that all humans share ancestors. But you'll be amazed at how recently those shared ancestors lived. Thanks to genetic data in the 21st century, we're even discovering that we really are all descended from one mother."
- [CRISPR and the Future of Human Evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pGNM9CTLJg&list=PLsmqeqKj7M-pS2SyV82Y4CGyihKLCW35w&index=4)
	- "In part 4 of our special series on human ancestry and evolution, we look into the future. Now that genetic engineering tools like CRISPR allow us to edit our genes, how will that impact human evolution going forward? Are designer babies or eugenics around the corner? Welcome to a world of nonrandom mutation and unnatural selection."
- [This Face TOTALLY Changes the Human Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ettIbYhADjI)
	- "Greetings, fellow Homo sapiens. Our species is the only remaining member of the genus of upright, walking apes known as Homo. Where did we come from? Our history just got a whole lot more complicated (in a good way) thanks to some incredible new fossils unearthed in South Africa over the past few years. I got to visit them, and the scientists who discovered them, to learn their story and ours. Meet your cousin: Homo naledi"

## Future evolution

- [Are Humans Still Evolving?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEhOZJ55Ve8&list=PLsmqeqKj7M-rZTTXNXuL07poGP5B6TKKu&index=4)
	- "We're living longer. Dying less. Human life expectancy has doubled in just a couple centuries. Machines and meals and medicines keeping us alive long past the age where we can make babies. Does this mean our species is no longer under the influence of natural selection? Have humans stopped evolving?"
- [CRISPR and the Future of Human Evolution - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pGNM9CTLJg&list=PLsmqeqKj7M-pS2SyV82Y4CGyihKLCW35w&index=4) - "In part 4 of our special series on human ancestry and evolution, we look into the future. Now that genetic engineering tools like CRISPR allow us to edit our genes, how will that impact human evolution going forward? Are designer babies or eugenics around the corner? Welcome to a world of nonrandom mutation and unnatural selection."

## Imperfect "design"

	- "If you were taking an engineering class in school and you turned in the human body for your final exam… you would get like, a C+. Or maybe a B- at best. That's because the human body is full of design flaws. Except they aren't really design flaws, because the human body wasn't designed. It was evolved, and it is still evolving. And that means some of our parts don't work as well as they could, they just work well enough. Here's a rundown of a few of the human body's biggest evolutionary fails!"

## Dinosaurs and birds

- [What Is A Dinosaur And What Isn't a Dinosaur?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_8h_Pwy15s)
	- "There's a lot of confusion out there about what is and isn't a dinosaur. And you'd be forgiven for being kinda confused. Maybe paleontologists are just messing with us. Or… maybe the question of what is and isn't a dinosaur goes deeper than we think? Well, like an intrepid fossil hunter, I set out to dig up an answer, and what I found teaches us a lesson about how hard it is to build a picture of the past when you only have a few puzzle pieces and a lot about why we classify things the way we do."

	- "Eating turkey this holiday season? Chowing down on a roast chicken? You're eating a dinosaur! Entertain your family and friends with a little science lesson this year, and show them why bird bones tell us that birds are actually living dinosaurs."

## Stable varieties/mixes of traits in species

- [What is an Allele? Quick Definition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsaYSGWuRmo)
	- "An allele is an alternate version of a gene. Does that sound confusing? If so, don't worry. I made this video for you that explains it nice and... clearly. Genetics = fun."
- [Evolutionarily Stable Strategies ft. Richard Dawkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUxt--mMjwA)
	- "When evolution favours a stable ratio of traits rather than one dominant trait."

## Genes and behavior

- [How Do Genes Influence Behavior? - Instant Egghead #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvk2g9hJMTs)
	- "Liberal or conservative; gay or straight; adventurous or cautious: How do genes influence our behavior and predispositions? Scientific American's Christine Gorman explains why the answer to this question is more complex than it first appears."

## Cooperation, prisoner's dilemma, and evolution

- [The Prisoner's Dilemma - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Lo2fgxWHw)
	- "The prisoners dilemma is a hypothetical game set up showing a situation where people won't want to work together even when it's beneficial to do so. It's just a long way of saying people don't like to be taken advantage of. Is often game theory 101."

	- "Why do genes cooperate so well? The truth is, they don't, at least not always. Here we explore how genes can rebel and what other genes in the genome must do to stop the rebels from ruining everything!"
