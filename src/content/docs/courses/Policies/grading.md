## Class Participation

Your class participation grade is based on how seriously I think you are engaged with the class. As a class, we will develop a rubric to set reasonable expectations about class participation. the following potential contributors to class participation:

- attendance
- engagement during class
- engagement and communication outside of class
- class preparation
- active contribution towards individual learning
- course feedback

I understand that some students are shy and have trouble speaking in class. Although speaking in class is an important and visible part of class participation, please note that only one of the factors above involves speaking in class, and you can participate in many other ways.



- regular, on-time attendance
- attentive and engaged during class
- asks questions and attempts to answer them, even when unsure (speaking counts as participation whether or not your answer is correct)
- reads and responds promptly to communications outside of class (such as email, discussion boards, and Telegram)
- comes to class prepared and with needed course materials
- takes initiative in addressing individual writing issues
- offers useful course feedback and/or suggests relevant resources
- participates constructively in small group activities

- , such as posting to the discussion boards, talking with me outside of class, completing all assignments on time, and emailing me interesting links relevant to the course.
  - I observe your contributions to small group discussions, not just whole-class discussions, and those count towards participation as well.
- I consider asking clarifying questions or suggesting answers that turn out to be wrong to be just as important as contributing new ideas and suggesting answers that turn out to be right. Your participation grade does not depend on saying only things that are correct.
- Actively listening to others is an important part of participating in discussion. Class discussions should not be competitive, with students striving to answer the most questions correctly. I am much more interested in whether the class as a whole develops a dialog that moves our understanding forward, and listening to others and asking clarifying questions is essential to that goal.
- One aspect of class participation is providing feedback to me about the course. At the end of every class, I will ask you to post questions or comments about anything we discussed in class that day. You can take this opportunity to provide me feedback about the course and my teaching to help me make continuous improvement.

## Exercises

Students will regularly submit short written exercises for class as a way to practice and reflect on writing skills.

Exercises are graded credit/no credit based on the following criteria:

- Demonstrates that the student read the exercise assignment carefully (i.e., all requested elements are included)
- Submitted by the deadline (or extended deadline if extension is requested)
- Reflects an honest attempt to do the exercise properly



- Assignments may be of three types:
  - Discussion posts on the Canvas "Discussion" pages
  - Short exercises individually submitted on Canvas
  - Short exercises to be written and distributed in class meetings for discussion.
- I do not expect the exercises to provide brilliant insights. I expect them to show your thoughts about the readings based on the prompt, even if your thoughts are confused or you have many questions.
- The exercises (and the papers!) should be written grammatically with a focus on simple language and clear communication.
  - Write grammatically so I know that any writing errors are not due to carelessness, but are things that I need to teach you.
  - Write with a focus on simple language and do NOT try to impress me or your classmates with your big vocabulary. It often backfires and goes against the main purpose of academic writing, which is communicating your ideas effectively.
- Formal citation and quotation is not necessary in short exercises (unless otherwise indicated)
- Do not do any outside research for the exercises. The exercises are ways to encourage your thinking, they are not research exercises where you are supposed to get ideas from other people or sources.
- Do not write introductions or conclusions for the exercises. Get right to the point.
- I may hand out copies of submitted exercises (with names removed) in class to aid discussion.
- exercises (and papers) are always due at 11:59pm. Proper sleep is important for health (both physical and mental) and I do not want you staying up late to finish.
- You may resubmit exercises until the deadline if needed (for example, if you accidentally deleted part of the response before submitting).
- Don't skip exercises because you are worried that your response won't be good enough. That will kill your grade. Submit something and even if you don't get credit, at least I can give you feedback.
- Never skip an exercise without communicating with me. You must complete all exercises to pass the course, including short exercises and all parts of each paper exercise. If you miss an exercise, write me to explain the lack of on-time submission and suggest a way to move forward.
- exercise Comments
	- I will not always make significant comments on your exercises, but I do read them all thoroughly.
	- I will write at least a word or two on your first exercise submitted through Canvas to make sure you can see future comments. Check to make sure.
	- I do not provide substantial written feedback on short exercises. Written feedback is extremely time-consuming to produce and it is simply impossible for me to provide it for every exercise. You will receive indirect feedback on your submission during class discussion, and you are _always_ welcome to ask for additional feedback by scheduling a meeting with me.

## Papers 1 and 2

Paper 1 asks students to respond to an argument from one of the assigned readings; Paper 2 asks students to contribute to an academic discussion about art and evolution using multiple sources.

Both papers will have students submit proposals, outlines, and/or drafts for instructor and peer feedback to make sure students have enough guidance to produce successful work. Explicit guidance and grading criteria will be provided in class and elsewhere on the course website.

## Student Examples

Students have told me that discussing anonymous examples from former students is extremely useful, and I use such examples regularly. I will assume that you are ok with me using your coursework for anonymous examples in future classes. Let me know if you have any concern about this; I can allow you to opt-out.
