## Summary of my course GenAI policy

- You are free to use or not use GenAI chatbots in this course.
- *Every* assignment in this course must include either 1) a transcript of all relevant GenAI use or 2) a statement that no GenAI was used.
- There is no penalty for using GenAI as long as you include the transcripts.

See the rest of the page for important details.

## What counts as GenAI?

In this course, Generative AI (hereafter GenAI) doesn't include basic computer-assisted editing such as Grammarly basic or the grammar check function in Word. GenAI includes [:tools that generate text and images](#x-genai-tools).

# :x GenAI tools

These tools include (but are not limited to) ChatGPT, Microsoft CoPilot, Gemini, Claude, dozens of new tools whose names I don't know, and the LLM your CS friend is running on their own server.

These tools count as GenAI regardless of how you use them--i.e. it's GenAI use even if you just ask the tool to check your spelling.

## Using GenAI in this course...

This course is fairly permissive about use of GenAI tools for your papers and assignments. The policy is: you may use GenAI chatbots ([:but only chatbots](#x-chatbots)) for any coursework with no penalty [:if you submit the actual chat transcript](#x-one-chat) with the assignment. If you use GenAI but don't submit the transcript, [:you've broken the rules](#x-no-submission).

This is not a trick, or an honesty test, or reverse psychology, or anything like that. I am doing this because I want to gather honest data about how students use GenAI in writing as part of my teaching research. Do not edit the chats, or worry that you said something dumb in the chats, or try to trick the system. I need honest data.

Further, I don't consider use of GenAI to be cheating. I want you to use GenAI if you want to try it. If you can figure out how to write the entire paper using GenAI with minimal effort, good for you. I'll give you an A if the final output is an A paper. But I MUST see how you use it because, so far, basically no one knows anything about how students actually use this technology and it's important that we all learn more about it.

I won't consider the content of your chats when grading your assignments. I likely won't even look at these transcripts during this term. I will collect them, anonymize them, and analyze them for my research after the terms ends.

Send the *entire* chat and *all* chats if you have more than one. I don't care if it's 100 pages long. Send it all; it's crucial data for my research.

# :x chatbots

This course allows use of GenAI chatbots, meaning tools like ChatGPT that use a chat interface--you enter a prompt and the AI responds with an output. Any chat input is allowed. You can copy-and-paste your paper into the chat if you like.

As GenAI tools get more sophisticated, other interfaces will develop. ChatGPT allows you to upload files, and perhaps other tools would let you upload a draft and output a revised draft with comments and suggested corrections in the margins. I don't want you to use these functions because I can't easily look at your full interaction with these tools, so it's hard for me to evaluate their effects.

So you are *not allowed* to upload files to GenAI or to use GenAI tools in any way other than basic chat. Doing so will be considered a violation of course and NUS policy.

# :x one chat

For each assignment, try to keep all of your GenAI interactions in one chat just to make it easier to give me the transcripts. However, if you do end up with multiple chats, you must include all of them.

# :x no submission

If you use GenAI, but *don't* submit the full transcript(s) with your assignment, it will be considered a violation of academic honesty with consequent (serious) penalties.

Below, I'm going to show you a very easy way to download and submit the transcripts. There really is no penalty for using GenAI, so don't risk failing the assignment or the course by forgetting to submit the transcript.

## If you don't use GenAI...

You are not expected to use GenAI, and it's fine if you don't. If you don't use GenAI on an assignment, you MUST end your submission with the statement, "I did not use GenAI in any way for this assignment."

## How to download chat transcripts

The easiest way to download chat transcripts is to use ChatGPT in the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) browser with the [:ChatGPT Convdown](#x-convdown) extension.

You can also use [:a different browser or GenAI tool](#x-different-tool), or you can copy and paste the chat transcript [:into a text file](#x-text-file). But you must make sure that the format matches [:the format used by the ChatGPT Convdown](/formatting.md/#genai-chats).

# :x text file

The transcript must be a text file with a `.txt` or `.md` file extension (the file extension is usually hidden on Macs). Don't save the transcript as `.html` or `.pdf`, as I can't analyze them.

# :x convdown

You can download the extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-convdown). The extension is [open-source](https://github.com/esteinmann/chatgpt-convdown) and seems trustworthy; let me know if you think there is any reason for concern.

ChatGPT Convdown downloads the transcript as a plain text file called a "Markdown" file, with extension `.md`. It's also ok to submit the transcript as a `.txt` file, but not as `.docx`, `.pdf`, or anything else. You don't need to know about Markdown, but can read more [:here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) if interested.

# :x different tool

I recommended one browser and extension combination, but you are welcome to use others if you can figure them out. If you find something that works, please let me know so I can tell other students.

## How to submit the transcript

If the assignment asks you to put your main submission in the online text box, add the markdown file using the `File Upload` tab.

If the assignment is submitted as a file, submit the markdown file as a second file by clicking  `Add another file` as shown here:

## NUS general GenAI policy

GenAI policy in this course should be understood in relation to the [:NUS Academic Honesty policy](#x-nus-genai).

# :x NUS GenAI

Please read NUS guidance on [use of AI tools generally](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/new2nus/acadintegrity#s-lib-ctab-22144949-4), [using AI tools for assignments](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/new2nus/acadintegrity#s-lib-ctab-22144949-5), and [plagarism](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/copyright_essentials_teaching_learning_research/plagiarism). Relevant sections of the NUS Code of Student Conduct are [here](https://www.nus.edu.sg/celc/statements-and-e-resources-on-plagiarism/).

## Instructor GenAI declaration

I've tried to use GenAI to help with teaching preparation and instruction, but so far I haven't found it very helpful. Nonetheless, I am still interested in experimenting with this possibility, so for the sake of transparency, I'm letting you know that I might use AI in the following ways:

- generate questions for in-class activities or optional (ungraded) online quizzes
- generate writing examples for discussion or to illustrate my points
- revise handouts or lecture notes
- revise online course content, including on Canvas and my course website
- revise my written feedback on assignments (I write the draft feedback without GenAI and do all final revisions)
