## Summary of the GenAI policy

- You are free to use or not use GenAI chatbots in this course [:in any way](#x-modified)
- *Every* assignment in this course must include either 1) a transcript of all relevant GenAI use or 2) a statement that no GenAI was used.
- There is no penalty for using GenAI as long as you submit your chat transcripts.

See the rest of the page for important details.

# :x modified

[Note to colleagues: I hope others will use a similar policy in their courses and provide me transcripts, and this summary statement can be modified by the instructor for each course. Another course might say "You are free to use or not use GenAI in any way for generating ideas or for receiving feedback on drafts you write yourself." I can modify language below to reflect changes you might want]

## What counts as GenAI?

In this course, Generative AI (hereafter GenAI) includes [:tools that generate text and images](#x-GenAI-tools) from prompts.

# :x GenAI tools

GenAI doesn't include basic computer-assisted editing like the grammar and spellcheck functions built into word processors.

It includes (but is not limited to) tools such as  ChatGPT, Microsoft CoPilot, Gemini, Claude, many other tools whose names I don't know, and home-run LLMs used for coursework.

These tools count as GenAI regardless of how you use them--i.e. it's GenAI use even if you just ask the tool to check your spelling.

## Using GenAI in this course...

The course's [:permissive GenAI policy](#x-permissive) is: you may use GenAI chatbots ([:but only chatbots](#x-chatbots)) for any coursework with no penalty if you submit [:the actual chat transcript](#x-one-chat) along with the assignment. If you use GenAI but don't submit [:the transcript](#x-submit-all), you've [:broken the rules](#x-no-submission).

Use or non-use of GenAI in this course [:will not affect your grade](#x-grade).

# :x permissive

This permissive GenAI policy is not a trick, or an honesty test, or reverse psychology. The course does not consider use of GenAI to be cheating. Although GenAI has many limitations, if you can figure out how to complete your coursework using GenAI with minimal effort, and your output earns the grade you want, that's fine with us.

Further, allowing GenAI in this course use is crucial for our research about student use of GenAI (your transcripts will be anonymized). We need honest data, so don't edit the chats, or worry that you said something dumb in the chats, or try to trick the system. There's no penalty for GenAI use, so you would just be corrupting the research data.

# :x submit all

Send the *entire* chat and *all* chats if you have more than one. I don't care if it's 100 pages long. Send it all.

# :x chatbots

This course allows use of GenAI chatbots, meaning tools like ChatGPT that use a chat interface--you enter a prompt and the AI responds with an output. Any chat input is allowed. You can copy-and-paste your paper into the chat if you like.

As GenAI tools get more sophisticated, other interfaces will develop. ChatGPT allows you to upload files and ask it to analyze them, and perhaps other tools will let you upload an essay draft and output a revised draft with comments and suggested corrections in the margins. It is much harder to analyze and evaluate the effects of these types of complex outputs than chat transcripts, so use GenAI only for chats.

To be clear, although you are allowed to copy and paste any text into the chat, you are *not allowed* to upload files to GenAI or to use GenAI tools in this course in any way other than basic chat (unless otherwise indicated by your instructor). Doing so will be considered a violation of course and NUS policy.

# :x one chat

For each assignment, try to keep all of your GenAI interactions in one chat just to make it easier to give me the transcripts. However, if you do end up with multiple chats, you must include all of them.

# :x no submission

If you use GenAI, but *don't* submit the full transcript(s) with your assignment, it will be considered a violation of academic honesty with consequent (serious) penalties.

Below, I'm going to show you a very easy way to download and submit the transcripts. There really is no penalty for using GenAI, so don't risk failing the assignment or the course by forgetting to submit the transcript.

# :x grade

We likely won't even look at most transcripts during the semester. We will collect them, anonymize them, and analyze them for research purposes after grades are in.

Even if we do look at the transcripts, if your coursework is up to A standards, you will receive an A--as long as you submit the entire transcript as requested.

## If you don't use GenAI...

You are not expected to use GenAI, and it's fine if you don't. If you don't use GenAI on an assignment, you MUST end your submission with the statement, "I did not use GenAI in any way for this assignment."

## How to download chat transcripts

The easiest way to download chat transcripts is to use ChatGPT in the [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) browser with the [:ChatGPT Convdown](#x-convdown) extension.

You can also use [:a different browser or GenAI tool](#x-different-tool), or you can copy and paste the chat transcript [:into a text file](#x-text-file). But you must make sure that the format matches [:the format used by the ChatGPT Convdown](/courses/policies/formatting/#GenAI-chats).

# :x text file

The transcript must be a text file with a `.txt` or `.md` file extension (the file extension is usually hidden on Macs). Don't save the transcript as `.html` or `.pdf`, as I can't analyze them.

# :x convdown

You can download the extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-convdown). The extension is [open-source](https://github.com/esteinmann/chatgpt-convdown) and seems trustworthy; let me know if you think there is any reason for concern.

ChatGPT Convdown downloads the transcript as a plain text file called a "Markdown" file, with extension `.md`. It's also ok to submit the transcript as a `.txt` file, but not as `.docx`, `.pdf`, or anything else. You don't need to know about Markdown, but can read more [:here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) if interested.

# :x different tool

I recommended one browser and extension combination, but you are welcome to use others if you can figure them out. If you find something that works, please let me know so I can tell other students.

## How to submit the transcript

If the assignment asks you to put your main submission in the online text box, add the markdown file using the `File Upload` tab.

If the assignment is submitted as a file, submit the markdown file as a second file by clicking  `Add another file` as shown here:

## NUS general GenAI policy

GenAI policy in this course should be understood in relation to the [:NUS Academic Honesty policy](#x-nus-genai).

# :x NUS GenAI

Please read NUS guidance on [use of AI tools generally](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/new2nus/acadintegrity#s-lib-ctab-22144949-4), [using AI tools for assignments](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/new2nus/acadintegrity#s-lib-ctab-22144949-5), and [plagarism](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/copyright_essentials_teaching_learning_research/plagiarism). Relevant sections of the NUS Code of Student Conduct are [here](https://www.nus.edu.sg/celc/statements-and-e-resources-on-plagiarism/).

## Instructor GenAI declaration

I've tried to use GenAI to help with teaching preparation and instruction, but so far I haven't found it very helpful. Nonetheless, I am still interested in experimenting with this possibility, so for the sake of transparency, I'm letting you know that I might use AI in the following ways:

- generate questions for in-class activities or optional (ungraded) online quizzes
- generate writing examples for discussion or to illustrate my points
- revise handouts or lecture notes
- revise online course content, including on Canvas and my course website
- revise my written feedback on assignments (I write the initial feedback without GenAI and do all final revisions)
