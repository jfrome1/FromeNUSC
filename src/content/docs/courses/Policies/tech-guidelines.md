## Canvas

- Notifications: set up Canvas notifications so you don't miss anything important. Use [these instructions](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-manage-my-Canvas-notification-settings-as-a-student/ta-p/434) so that you are immediately notified for categories "Course Content", "Due Date", "Discussions", and "Announcement".

## Course email

- Important: You are responsible for checking class email daily! Although many students avoid email, it is still the primary way instructors communicate and is the only NUS-authorized and supported electronic messaging system the course will use.
- Subject line: Put the course code (e.g. NTW2029) in the subject line of EVERY email you send me so it will be filtered into the correct class email folder.
- Name: Use the name I call you in class in addition to your formal name so I know who you are right away.
- Tone: If you are writing about a way you might not meet course expectations, don't send it as an FYI (e.g. "Prof, I'm leaving class an hour early tomorrow because I have an important football game"). That can come across as rude or entitled in a small class like ours because it might affect me or others. Instead, please ask me for permission and gauge my response. Even if you are going to do it regardless of the consequences, this approach is less abrasive.
- Follow-up: I aim to respond to all emails within one business day.If you haven't heard from me, or if the matter is time-sensitive, feel free to email me again to remind me. I won't be annoyed. Sometimes an email just gets buried in my inbox.

## Digital calendar

- You _must_ have a calendar with your course due dates on it. I don't know a single adult who doesn't use a calendar. I don't know a single student who has missed an assignment who DID use a calendar (i.e., students who forget to submit are always those that don't use and/or check their calendars). Your life may have worked just fine without a calendar until now. It won't in the future. Set up a calendar, put all assignment due dates on it right at the beginning of the semester, check the calendar daily, and if your calendar is electronic, make sure to set up a default one-day advance reminder for assignment due dates.
